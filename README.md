# Weather App

Weather App is a simple yet functional weather forecasting application that allows users to get real-time weather data for any location. It fetches current weather information from a public API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. This project is ideal for learning about API integration, React component structure, and dynamic data rendering in modern web development.

## Project Overview

The Weather App was built with React to demonstrate how a web application can interact with third-party APIs to retrieve and render dynamic weather information. Users can enter any city and view real-time temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions. This app is particularly useful for those learning how to work with API calls, React hooks, and conditional rendering.

## Features

- Fetches weather data from a public weather API
- Real-time weather updates based on user input
- Responsive and clean UI
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind, and weather status
- Search functionality for any city worldwide
- Error handling for invalid or unknown city names

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building UI components
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For logic and interactivity
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **HTML**: Markup structure
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (or similar): Source of weather data

## Installation

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrkankilic27/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
npm install
npm start
```

The application will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

1. Launch the application in a web browser.
2. Type the name of a city in the search box.
3. Press enter or click the search icon.
4. Weather information will be displayed below.

## Development

To contribute or make local changes:

- `npm start` – Run the application in development mode
- `npm run build` – Build the app for production
- `npm test` – Run tests (if implemented)
